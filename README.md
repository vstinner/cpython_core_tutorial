# Description

Tutorial to contribute to the CPython project.

# Design and goal of the tutorial

The final goal is to train contributors to promote them to CPython core
developers. That's the long term goal.

The short term goal is to fill the gap in the current devguide between
"compile/install python" and "congrats! you are now a CPython core developer!".
Document all the things expected to be known to become a core developer.

# Installation

You need to use a installed version of [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/).

For that, you have two options. Firstly, use the sphinx package from your favorite distribution

## Fedora

```bash
dnf install python-sphinx
```

## Debian/Ubuntu

```bash
apt-get install python3-sphinx
```


# Compilation

Once you have an installed version of [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/), you can build the documentation.

```bash
make html
```

The result will be in `build/html/index.html`

You can check it via [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) if you run the following commands

```bash
cd build/html/
python3 -m http.server
```
