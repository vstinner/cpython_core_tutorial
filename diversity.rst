Diversity Statement:

    The Python Software Foundation and the global Python community welcome and
    encourage participation by everyone. Our community is based on mutual
    respect, tolerance, and encouragement, and we are working to help each
    other live up to these principles. We want our community to be more
    diverse: whoever you are, and whatever your background, we welcome you.

For example, don't say "hey *guys*!" but "hey **everyone**!".
